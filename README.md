### Hi there! :wave:

My name is Rudi Antoni and I'm a software developer from 🇧🇷 Brazil.

I liked software development since my first contact, which was with the C programming language for PIC microcontrollers :anguished:. Since then, I just like every type and possible branch inside and around software development.

- :seedling: I'm currently learning Spring Batch framework in Java, and much more are on the way!
- :telescope: If you want to see what I'm currently learning, take a look at [learning repositories](#learning-repositories) below.
- :thinking: I’m looking for help with DevOps, including Docker and Kubernetes. These are my next goals to achieve.
- :speech_balloon: I already have developed personal learning projects using a lot of different technologies that are not present here, maybe someday I'll create some and publish them but that's not the point right now. Here they are, sorted by proficiency in ascending order:
  - C, C++ and Pawn
  - PHP (Magento, Wordpress, TemplatePower, Smarty and CodeIgniter)
  - Lua
  - HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Ajax and jQuery).
  - :green_circle: React
  - :green_circle: Java and Kotlin (JPA, Spring Boot Web and Data)
  - :green_circle: PostreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL Server and MongoDB.
- :speech_balloon: The ones marked with :green_circle: are those which I keep in touch almost in a daily basis.
- :zap: Fun fact: The first language I learned was C, but it's the one i'm the least proficient with.
